    "**Assignment Question: How does United State's Life Satisfaction compare with other nations and is Life Satisfaction of a country related to it's GDP per capita?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization is concerned with answering the above question, how does United State's Life Satisfaction compare with other nations and is Life Satisfaction of a country related to it's GDP per capita. The two datasets for this assignment were obtained from 'Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development' website (http://www.oecd.org/). Data (Life Satisfaction and GDP per capita) from a collection of developing and developed nations were extracted, while others dropped, so as not to clutter the resulting plot to decrease graph functionality. Relative Life Satisfaction of the selected nations, including United States, was plotted against GDP per capita for the year 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph indicates that there is indeed a strong correlation between the two metrics (Life Satisfaction and GDP per capita) as measured by Scipy's Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.636 but the relationship is not in anyway linear as shown by the Linear Regression plot in the graph. While United State's Life Satisfaction is among the developed nations' cluster (denoted by red filled circles) and higher than most developing nations (denoted by yellow filled circles) but some developing countries like Mexico and Chile are not too far off from advanced nations like United States and indeed higher than France and Luxembourg, two nations with the highest GDP per capita among the selected nations. Thus, this visualization signifies that Life satisfaction depends on a multitude of factors, not just GDP per capita, which may include Affordable Healthcare, Good K-12 and Higher Education, Cost-of-living, affordable and quality Housing, country's infrastructure like security and transport, etc."
